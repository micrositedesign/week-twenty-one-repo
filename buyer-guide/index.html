It is also harder to remember longer domain names. The ideal domain length is 12 characters or less, but you can have a domain up to 15 characters long if you need it. Try not to go over 15 characters because certain social media sites don’t support social media handles longer than 15 characters.</p>

You never know when you need to give someone your website verbally, and someone listening to you share the web address should be easy for them to understand. You can ask people to pronounce your domain name when they read it to see if it rolls off the lips, or if it needs to be revised.

On the one hand, funny spellings, or words that can be spelled different ways can make it difficult for people to find your website, and misspellings can make your site look suspicious. On the other hand, unconventional ways of spelling your company can make your company stand out, especially if it is catchy. Just remember people need to type the address easily, and word-of-mouth may have people wondering how to spell the domain.</p>

Something creative and innovative is always better than something generic. Your brand tells your organization’s story. An ideal brand uses a name that may have no specific meaning on its own, it is easy to memorize, it is unique, it is trustworthy and it is easy to pronounce. Your brand is your foundation.</p>

Do they have a domain name that is easy to type? Probably, yes. A good way to test if your domain name is easy to type is to ask a friend or relative to type it for you. If you have to give them multiple hints, the domain is probably too complex, and it may not be the right one for you. Also avoid using words that can be spelled different ways.</p>

Domain names can lead to an impression of your company for the better, and sometimes for the worse. This is not to say that a domain name does this on its own. The user experience on the actual website can also lead to good and bad impressions. Committing to a domain name has positive and negative connotations felt years down the road.

You also want to avoid legal issues with potential domains that already have trademarks associated with them.

Keep in mind certain names can’t be trademarked, and it may help if you get a legal consult regarding the trademark.

              <p class="information-section">A really good way to get your creative juices flowing when it comes to picking a domain name is to use an old-fashioned thesaurus. A thesaurus will help you find other words that are similar to a word you are looking for in your potential domain name search. Finding cheaper available domain names that are memorable, short, and brandable is not always an easy task, so utilizing your available resources will help you achieve your domain name goals.</p>

              <p class="information-section">A registrar is the company you use to register a domain name on your behalf. You are able to perform free searches on a registrar’s website for your potential domain name. If you find a domain name you want, you create an account with the registrar and purchase it. Different registrars offer domains for different prices, and they may include different benefits for registering. Use respectable and trustworthy registrars so there are fewer problems down the road.</p>

              <p class="information-section">Domain names come and go very quickly. If you find a domain name that has not been registered, and you want it, it is in your best interest to purchase it sooner than later. Remember, as long as the domain is available, anyone may register it at any time, and this includes anyone around the world. Keep in mind once you register a domain, that registration is good for a year. This means you have a whole year to decide if you want to keep the domain. It also means if you decide to get rid of it you are only out the cost of registration which is not a very big investment. Of course, premium domains are a different story.</p>

              <p class="information-section">This recommendation may cause some controversy, but Domainers Anonymous sees it only one way. When you purchase hosting from a web host, a lot of times the web host will throw in a free domain name registration as part of the web hosting package. As tempting as this may be, we think it is a better choice to register the domain name yourself. This gives you ultimate control over the domain, and should you leave the web hosting company for someone else in the future, you do not need to worry about issues with transferring the domain away from the old host.</p>

ID Protection conceals this personally identifiable information and replaces it with the registrar’s information. In some cases, having your information viewable is a better option.</p>

              <p class="information-section">Your domain name is typically registered for a period of 12 months, but this can be extended when first registering the domain with the registrar, or during any period the domain name is in good standing with the registrar. Once the time period of the registration is up, and the domain was not renewed, the domain typically goes into a grace period before the domain is released back into the domain pool or auctioned off. Sometimes the domain registrant is not aware their domain registration is set to expire leading to headaches and potential website access issues. It is recommended that you set the domain to auto-renew by having a credit card on file with the registrar.</p>
